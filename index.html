            <p>Please help me I am an S-rank student at Akita Prefecture Secondary School. I spent my nights late in the computer lab hard at work studying while the other boys are off with the girls. I just never
            really understood girls....except Mitsuke. But that's besides the point. One night, late into studying Kaiju Historomics, all of the computers suddenly turned on. The next thing I remember, I am trapped online.
            Please help me escape, I promised Mitsuke I would finish her notes and I'm afraid she might not get them before third period.....</p>
